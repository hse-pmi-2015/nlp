epilepsy patients seeking laser ablation related in july 2018 we made updates to our epilepsy surgery clinical policies based on recently published data said the new guidelines cover laser ablation

credit to the diminutive teen with the powerful voice she really advocated for herself and it worked out for her whatever happened it got her the appropriate treatment got to hand it to her added has been an inspiration to all those who have had the privilege of caring for her her advocacy and courage will hopefully clear the way for other epilepsy patients who could benefit from this surgery never been more excited the day of the surgery july 25 was filled with nerves and excitement parents and older sister lindsey crowded her hospital room before the operation they gabbed about trivial everyday stuff as families often do but make no mistake the importance of the day weighed on everyone told staff at north shore university hospital in she had never been more excited for anything in my life her first grand seizure when she fell to the floor and shook came at the age of but she remembers having smaller aura seizures when she would space out for brief spells as far back as kindergarten she can have five seizures in day sometimes as many as 30 it been really really difficult to live with she said keeps box filled with various anti seizure medications from over the years about of epilepsy patients live with uncontrollable seizures because no available treatment works for them according to the epilepsy foundation as she was wheeled off to the operating room dad wrapped his arms around lindsey and held her reassuring her that would be ok had waited until summer to undergo the surgery that way she could adjust to any changes in her brain activity before the new school year started laser ablation is still emerging in the care of epilepsy patients and mother said she hopes her daughter can serve as an example for other teens who qualify for laser surgery and are afraid of open brain surgery known as temporal this really gives people hope who are young and dealing with this that they can go forward early on in life and get this procedure done she says in the operating room the procedure went quite well said everything went as planned there are only about 40 to 50 around the nation said where laser ablation surgeries are performed with the technique becoming more popular in recent years said existing data show about 50 seizure free rate for those who undergo laser ablation compared to about 70 who undergo traditional open brain surgeries comprehensive study is to better define its efficacy but said he has had better success than the national average my results are about as good as the open temporal the laser surgery is more appealing to patients and parents he says because open surgery can be so daunting laser surgery is less invasive requires less time in the hospital and has quicker recovery said poses for pictures outside the banquet hall at beach state park as friends snap photos you look like princess one friend says patients can suffer short term memory loss especially forgetting names of people they meet it not usually something that is devastating especially when you younger he says given that she young we believe that her brain is going to be more able to adapt had one grand seizure in the days after the surgery but she forgotten to take her anti seizure medicine the day before also says it not unusual for patients to have seizures in the week or two right after surgery based on her recovery three weeks after surgery he believes has 60 to 80 chance of being seizure free the benchmark will be year from now the big question is whether she will have one or two seizures year or whether she has no seizures says we want no seizures keeping my fingers crossed new vibrant at her birthday party the new is on full display she dances she laughs she commands the crowd father robert requested slow dance with his

      "(CNN) Consider the glorious but humble donkey. According to the Bible, Jesus rode one, not a horse, into Jerusalem.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance was that it was a common man's animal for the common man's king, rather than a more traditionally royal steed. And its Sunday school lore that his mother rode one from Nazareth while pregnant, though that's not in the official canon. I checked.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domesticated for about 5,000 years, donkeys have been put to work for humanity's historically changing needs. They've been the family car, our U-Haul vans, engines pulling barges in canals and wagons out West, and they've been our workmates -- if you work in a mine or on a farm. They're still used in military operations to carry ground air missiles over difficult terrain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Burros, as the Spanish call them, walk at about a human's foot speed. They rarely kick or bite. They seem to have a calming effect on horses and humans. And they don't get nearly the respect they deserve, the Rodney Dangerfields of the animal kingdom.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a cross between a Tesla and a wheelbarrow, donkeys are beasts of burden that can carry up to 300 pounds for more than two weeks in the mountains, while needing very little food or water. They're sort of the camels of the West. In fact, they're the camels of the East, North and South, too, as donkeys continue to thrive in North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "As some industries faded, the donkey soon added racing partner to its resume. When the US mining industry started to dry up in the 1930s and '40s, some enterprising Coloradans came up with the idea of attracting spectators to their towns by hosting an ultramarathon of human-donkey pairs -- The World Championship Pack Burro Race.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"They teach us so much,\" said pack burro race director Brad Wann. \"They teach us humility. They connect us with nature. Burros have the ability to reach into your soul.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The first race was in 1949, which makes it, according Wann, the second-oldest continuously run marathon in the country after the Boston Marathon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race also lends itself to a variety of puns. For example, the winner of the annual pack burro championship is the first to get his or her ass over the finish line. Wann's title is media relations officer for the Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation . There are eight of these eye-rollers in this article if you'd like to spot them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it's still a serious sport, even if it has a sense of humor. \" Haulin' Ass \" is the title of a very straight documentary about the sport.\n",
      "\n",
      "A burro-ful day\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally the race extended between Leadville and Fairplay, located in the middle of the state and only about 11 miles apart as the crow flies, but separated by a mountain. Legend holds that it was inspired by two miners who struck gold simultaneously and raced back to town to claim the find. The real story is that the race was inspired by a desire to keep former mining towns from turning into ghosts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now both towns have their own races, part of an annual series of eight in Colorado. Fairplay, is the longest (29 miles), tied for highest (more than 13,000 feet), and the one that retained the World Championship title. The town is also home to the Prunes Monument, possibly the only monument in the world erected to honor a donkey. Prunes worked alongside a miner for more than 60 years.\n",

Hide Caption 5 of 11 Photos: Pack Burro World Championship Running with a donkey is a bit of give and take, literally. Sometimes you're pulling them, other times, they're pulling you.

Runners benefit with getting as many miles together as possible on training runs. Humans need to acclimate to higher elevations, but donkeys don't.

      "\n",
      "Race day, in July, was a cool one of blue skies. This year 89 -- a record number -- of human-burro pairs competed in the 70th world championship, assembling in the Old West-looking Fairplay. Wann estimates at least 150,000 people showed up to watch the start of the race.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smell of excitement and excrement was in the air as the starter gun signaled a mass start of two lengths. The 29-mile race had 20 pairs and 3,300 feet of elevation gain and a short course of 15 miles had another 69 pairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The start of the race is critical, explained Wann. \"Don't break their will, let the burro set the pace early on instead of shutting it down,\" he explained. \"Burros will pair up and want to go that pace, and you have to feel that out. So run as fast you can -- sprint if the donkey does. If you can't do that you'll have a slow donkey the rest of the race. It's a burro race, not a human race.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The course also ends in Fairplay, running through South Park (the show of the same name has somehow not done a burro racing episode), and then heading up dirt roads, trails and rocky terrain to the 13,185-foot summit of Mosquito Pass. (Or should that be Mosquito P-ass?)\n",
      "\n",
      "The age range of the human runners at this year's world championship was 15 to 70, and they came from all over the US, Europe, Canada and even Africa. The California team brought in their own donkeys. About 65% were repeat runners addicted to the niche sport which consistently only takes place in Colorado, the state where it was born.\n",
      "\n",
      "About a third of the runners were women this year. In fact, the first woman to ever compete was Edna Miller, with her burro Pill, in 1951, nearly 20 years before the first woman ran the Boston Marathon (against the rules, even then).\n",

      "\"In the whole world, there are probably fewer than 1,000 people who have ever competed in a pack-burro race,\" the late Denver Post columnist Ed Quillen wrote in 2007 , arguing for it to be the state's official sport. (In 2012, pack burro racing was designated a summer heritage sport of Colorado.)\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to be among this elite crew, your training is two-fold. You need to condition yourself to run long distances — putting in the hours on trail runs and at high altitudes -- as the pack burro race is a very challenging course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is driving a donkey. They don't need to acclimate to the altitude or learn how to properly fuel themselves with calories and hydration to go the distance. But runners still benefit with getting as many miles together as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are techniques and personality differences among the animals that need to be m-ass-tered to have a successful run. \"If the burro doesn't trust you, or like you, or you are pushing too hard,\" said Wann, \"it's not going to work.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizers don't recommend it but you can show up the day before a burro pack race and rent a donkey. Amber Wann, a self described \"donkey matchmaker\" and wife of Brad, rents them for races and tries to match running speed and equine experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Burro racing is a very mental game,\" he added. \"We're navigating through some of the roughest terrain in the world and you have to build a relationship with your ass to make that happen.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Running with a donkey is a bit of give and take, literally. Sometimes you're pulling them, other times they're pulling you. Uphill they can be a real ass-et if they are in the lead and pulling a bit. But going downhill, runners want to be in the lead lest they find themselves getting dragged by a fast and enthusiastic 900-pound burro which can haul ass at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "On flats, either teammate can be in the lead, or side-by-side, but human runners are still doing the steering.\n",
      "\n",
      "You control a donkey through their nose, pulling back on the rope to slow down, like a gas pedal of pressure-and-release to change speed. A whistle or a \"hup-hup!\" can get 'em goin' and the classic \"whoa\" can slow 'em down. The donkey of course doesn't know where it's going. Humans are the \"GPS for the critters,\" Wann said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gear-wise, runners need the right shoes, clothes, running vests and fuel for an ultramarathon. And the burros, in addition to getting a clean bill of health from a vet, need the old timey mining equipment and added weight to carry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ass-essing risk and reward\n",
      "\n",
      "As with any ultramarathon trail run, injuries are always possible. According to a 2015 study involving 1,212 active ultrarunners, they suffered about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners , though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being tethered to a donkey adds risk of injury to runners, of course. If you trip, you can get serious road rash from getting dragged along. One year a runner bruised or broke some ribs when her burro kicked her in the chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rules don't allow runners to ride the donkey, but in the race's history, injured runners have been carried down the mountain on their partners' back, as they're out of the race anyway.\n",

      "Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Donkeys get injured too, but in 70 years of racing, not one animal has died or been injured beyond recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animal rights groups have raised eyebrows about the sport but organizers stress the humane treatment of the burros. \"Any contestant mistreating his animal may be disqualified,\" the race rules state. \"No needles, electric prods, narcotics, clubs or whips, other than the halter rope, may be used.\" But the runners' love for their donkey partners makes this rule seemingly superfluous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Organizers also point out that donkeys enjoy the race as much as the ultra-runners. \"If you observe donkeys in the wild, they aren't sedentary creatures,\" wrote Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation member Sheri L. Thompson on the sport's race website. \"In the wild, donkeys are very trim athletic animals\" and \"they exercise all day long.\"\n",

      "The details of the race are a well-guarded secret, and they won't be divulged here. The names of landmarks in the instructions -- Quitter's Road, Rat Jaw -- don't correspond to labels on any official map.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one portion that's not a secret is Brushy Mountain State Penitentiary, which closed for prison business in 2009. Barkley runners jump into a creek and wade through a tunnel that goes under the jail, emerging just steps away from the wall that Ray and his fellow escapees jumped. You can arrange a tour inside the crumbling prison. Ray's cell was No. 27. My guide repeated that the place is haunted without a wink or any indication that she was kidding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The race takes place every spring, a season when weather fluctuates from warm and muggy one hour to freezing and wet the next. Some years, there has been snow to run through and temperatures 10 degrees below freezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is the only place you can have 45-mile-per-hour winds and pea soup fog,\" Laz said, pausing for his punch line: \"at the same time.\" This year, it started pleasantly cool and cloudy, but rain and cold punished them as the hours went by.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between each loop, runners will eat, doctor their feet, maybe steal a quick nap. Some rest at base camp as little at 15 minutes, others an hour before being given a new bib number (to get a new page from the checkpoints). The direction of the race changes between loops as well, adding another level of difficulty and more orienteering. In the first four loops, two are clockwise, two counter-clockwise. If more than one runner makes it to the fifth loop, each runner is sent in opposing directions for the final marathon.\n",
      "\n",
      "No one made it past three loops this year. Just over half made it to the second loop, five made it to the third loop, and only one finished the third. As racers dropped out, a bugler played taps. Like some previous years, it was played 40 times. Laz thought two factors that led to the lack of finishers this year were the weather and that he chose fewer Barkley veterans than usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finishing is so rare, there is a web page of quotes on what the experience was like. Brett Maune, 2011's only finisher, calculated \"4/5 Pure Joy, 1/5 Pure Hell.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Thompson finished in 2009, after setting the speed record for the 2,160-mile Appalachian Trail in 47½ days. \"Finishing [the Barkley] was not at all what I expected,\" he wrote. \"All the emotion and hoopla and sense of accomplishment with which I had begun Loop 5 were quickly worn down to nubs. The 'victory' lap quickly turned into survival mode. I was sick, and cold, and damn happy to be done.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Only one person, Jared Campbell, has finished the race three times. \"I am thrilled,\" he said after finishing in 2016, \"setting a new personal standard for how much adventure I can extract out of $1.60.\" In 2014, he was more philosophical: \"There are lessons in life that can only be learned through fairly massive deviations from our normal, comfortable routines. They can sharpen our optimism and generate a deeper appreciation for the simple things in life.\" And in 2012, he was nearly psychedelic: \"Due to some extreme foot pain (skin) and sleep deprivation I experienced an incredible distillation of my physical and mental self down to a few basic senses and thoughts, which was both an educational and beautiful experience.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, finisher Nickademus Hollon quoted Plato: \"The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "'A different breed'\n",
      "\n",
      "To reach the Barkley, you will have done massive amounts of trail and endurance running -- even for the annual \"human sacrifice,\" as Laz playfully labels one person who he predicts doesn't have the right stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you're just getting into trail running or adventure racing, you have to put in your vertical hours. Many long-distance runners train in intervals, also known as periodization, building strength by alternating hard and easy weeks of exertion and recovery. Most of the runners in the Barkley run ultra-distances year-round so don't need a training program that starts with short runs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of the Barkley or other unmarked trail races, it is also essential to be able to read a topographical map, something of a dying skill as technology and a lack of wooded adventure rob us of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the documentary crew member and King's killer, no Barkley runner has ever got so lost in the area's woods (Laz: \"100% self-extraction\") that they needed rescuing before they faced starvation or hypothermia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although GPS devices aren't allowed in the Barkley, plenty of other gear is, including compasses, walking sticks and trail running backpacks with food and water. Many long-distance runners prefer quality, thick-soled shoes; a light but warm jacket for nights and peaks; a hydration pack; portable food; salt tablets; and a powerful headlamp for night running. Unlike other ultramarathons, this one does not have gear requirements. These runners know what they're doing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Training in the sport also includes learning how to avoid injuries, but that's not always possible. Injuries such as cuts and sprains are typical on the Barkley, but nothing has ever halted a runner in their tracks. The worst injury was a kneecap that \"snapped in two,\" Laz said, and the runner still finished the loop. \"It's a different breed,\" he cackled.\n",
      "\n",
      "though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures. Ultrarunners suffer about the same frequency of injuries as shorter-distance runners, according to a recent study by the University of California, Davis and Stanford University,though some wounds were inflicted by the obstacles of trail running. Among the 1,212 active ultrarunners in the study, injuries were also more prevalent among younger (under age 40), less-experienced runners. Most (64.6%) reported an exercise-related injury that resulted in lost training days over the previous year, but that didn't translate to additional missed days at work. The most common injuries were of the knee and foot stress fractures.\n",

      "\n",
      "That study also found that while ultrarunners tended to be older than the general running population, they had fewer incidents of heart disease and other chronic conditions. They were more likely than the general population to have allergies, hay fever and exercise-induced asthma, probably due to high levels of exposure to pollen-gifting nature. In general, running is outstanding cardio exercise, benefiting much of the body and tied to greater health outcomes than the general population.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the mental rewards -- well, that's a journey that is as unique as the individual and certainly not guaranteed. A \"sense of accomplishment\" is an expression that grossly undersells the thrill of finishing a race as special and difficult at the Barkley. And yet to get to whatever personal heaven awaits you at the finish line, it most certainly means going through hell to get there.\n",
